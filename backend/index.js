 * 
 * API ENDPOINTS:
 * - POST /api/chat - Send message, get AI response
 * 
 * ERROR HANDLING:
 * - If Gemini AI fails, automatically uses demo responses
 * - No downtime - chatbot always responds
 * 
 * CUSTOMIZATION:
 * - Add more demo responses to DEMO_REPLIES array
 * - Modify the AI prompt in the chat endpoint
 * - Add new API endpoints for additional features
